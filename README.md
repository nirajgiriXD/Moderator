This project is about a program being able to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment in a sentence, article or any other written form of document. 
It would be of great use in platform such as social media for finding out post which might contain offensive or vulgar content. 
The program is based on file handling. 
The algorithm checks for phrases that might be of positive or negative sentiment then it counts those checkpoints and gives percentage of how much positive or negative the text is.

Note: It has nothing to do with AI or ML.
